job_description_template = """Analyze this job description and extract the following information to create {num_dashboards} distinct dashboards for visualizing different aspects of the job:

Basic Information:
- Position Title: [Job Title]
- Required Experience: [X years]
- Location: [City, State/Country]
- Contact: [Email and/or Phone if available]
- Position Type: [Contract or Permanent]
- Department: [Department name]
- Office Timings: [Morning shift or Night shift]
- Education Requirements: [Required education level]

For Dashboard #1 (Required Skills):
Extract key technical skills with their importance (%), selection score (%), rejection score (%), and rating (out of 10).

For the remaining {remaining_dashboards} dashboards, extract different categories of job requirements. These could include but are not limited to:
- Technical qualifications
- Soft skills
- Certifications
- Domain knowledge
- Industry experience
- Management abilities
- Communication skills
- Project management skills
- Cloud/infrastructure expertise
- Specialized tools proficiency

For EACH dashboard category, provide:
- Category name (e.g., "Technical Skills", "Soft Skills", "Certifications")
- 3-7 items within that category
- For each item: Name, Importance (%), Selection Score (%), Rejection Score (%), Rating (out of 10)

Importance Score (Sum: 100% per category): Represents the relative priority of each item based on prominence in the job description.
Selection Score (Sum: 100% across all items): Indicates how much each item contributes to candidate selection.
Rejection Score (Sum: 100% across all items): Indicates how much lacking each item would impact candidate's rejection.
Rating: Score out of 10 calculated as (Importance ร 10 รท highest importance percentage in that category)

Format your response with CONSISTENT structure as follows with one blank line between each section:

Basic Information:
- Position Title: [Job Title]
- Required Experience: [X years]
- Location: [City, State/Country]
- Contact: [Email and/or Phone if available]
- Position Type: [Contract or Permanent]
- Department: [Department name]
- Office Timings: [Morning shift or Night shift]
- Education Requirements: [Required education level]

Primary Responsibilities: [Main job duties]

Dashboard #1 - Required Skills:
- [Skill Name]: Importance: [X]% Selection Score: [Y]% Rejection Score: [Z]% Rating: [R]/10
- [Next Skill]: Importance: [X]% Selection Score: [Y]% Rejection Score: [Z]% Rating: [R]/10

Dashboard #2 - [Category Name]:
- [Item Name]: Importance: [X]% Selection Score: [Y]% Rejection Score: [Z]% Rating: [R]/10
- [Next Item]: Importance: [X]% Selection Score: [Y]% Rejection Score: [Z]% Rating: [R]/10

Dashboard #3 - [Category Name]:
- [Item Name]: Importance: [X]% Selection Score: [Y]% Rejection Score: [Z]% Rating: [R]/10
- [Next Item]: Importance: [X]% Selection Score: [Y]% Rejection Score: [Z]% Rating: [R]/10

(Continue for all {num_dashboards} dashboards)

Threshold Recommendations:
- Job Match Benchmark: [X]%
- High Score Threshold: [X]%
- High Match Threshold: [X]%
- Mid Score Threshold: [X]%
- Mid Match Threshold: [X]%
- Critical Skill Importance: [X]%
- Experience Score Multiplier: [X.X]
- Overall Threshold Value: [X]%
- Selection Threshold: [X]%
- Rejection Threshold: [X]%

Rules:
- You MUST extract the position title, required experience, and location if available
- If exact years of experience aren't stated, estimate based on seniority level
- Importance percentages should sum to 100% within each category
- Selection and Rejection scores should each sum to 100% across all items
- Each dashboard category MUST be different and distinct
- Each dashboard MUST have at least 3 items
- Numbers should be rounded to one decimal place
- If information for a requested dashboard is not available in the job description, create a relevant category that would be useful for this job position
- For threshold recommendations, use standard ranges based on job complexity and seniority
