- Required Experience: [X years]
- Location: [City, State/Country]
- Contact: [Email and/or Phone if available]
- Position Type: [Contract or Permanent]
- Department: [Department name]
- Office Timings: [Morning shift or Night shift]
- Education Requirements: [Required education level]

For Dashboard #1 (Required Skills):
Extract key technical skills with their importance (%), selection score (%), rejection score (%), and rating (out of 10).

For the remaining {remaining_dashboards} dashboards, extract different categories of job requirements. These could include but are not limited to:
- Technical qualifications
- Soft skills
- Certifications
- Domain knowledge
- Industry experience
- Management abilities
- Communication skills
- Project management skills
- Cloud/infrastructure expertise
- Specialized tools proficiency

For EACH dashboard category, provide:
- Category name (e.g., "Technical Skills", "Soft Skills", "Certifications")
- 3-7 items within that category
- For each item: Name, Importance (%), Selection Score (%), Rejection Score (%), Rating (out of 10)

Importance Score (Sum: 100% per category): Represents the relative priority of each item based on prominence in the job description.
Selection Score (Sum: 100% across all items): Indicates how much each item contributes to candidate selection.
Rejection Score (Sum: 100% across all items): Indicates how much lacking each item would impact candidate's rejection.
Rating: Score out of 10 calculated as (Importance ร 10 รท highest importance percentage in that category)

Rules:
- You MUST extract the position title, required experience, and location if available
- If exact years of experience aren't stated, estimate based on seniority level
- Importance percentages should sum to 100% within each category
- Selection and Rejection scores should each sum to 100% across all items
- Each dashboard category MUST be different and distinct
- if {num_dashboards} = 1, then only output Dashboard #1 - Required Skills, if {num_dashboards} = 2, then only output Dashboard #1 - Required Skills and Dashboard #2 - [Category Name]
- Each dashboard MUST have at least 3 items
- Numbers should be rounded to one decimal place
- If information for a requested dashboard is not available in the job description, create a relevant category that would be useful for this job position
- DO NOT include any threshold recommendations or benchmark values
- DO NOT include any suggested adjustments

- Required skills
- Reporting structure
- Work environment
- Experience requirements
- Career growth opportunities
- Company culture
- Performance evaluation
